# Design

This document describes the engine in `rust/tessera-sort`. It makes the same decisions as the research prototype (`sort-research-rs`, commit `6c0877f`); the [port record](port.md) lists how the port reaches them differently.

## Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Key | The unsigned integer a record sorts by. Signed integers, floats and `Reverse` keys are encoded into unsigned keys whose integer order matches the requested order. |
| Digit | A window of key bits handled by one pass, described by a shift and a width. |
| Node | A slice larger than the tile budget. Nodes are split by a stable block partition. |
| Tile | A slice that fits the tile budget, 64 KiB of records by default and at most 65,535 records. Tiles are finished in scratch memory. |
| Cursor table | One `u16` position per bucket. At 14 bits it occupies 32 KiB. |

## Pipeline

### 1. Order probe

The engine samples up to 4,096 evenly spaced adjacent pairs to classify the input as ascending, descending, flat (every sampled pair equal) or unsorted. An ascending or descending sample is confirmed by a full scan, which takes its direction from the first unequal key. A confirmed ascending input returns immediately. A confirmed descending input is reversed stably: the whole slice is reversed, then each run of equal keys is reversed back. A flat sample is confirmed after the varying-bit scan below, since a constant input stops there.

An unsorted input gets a budgeted stable insertion pass. When the probe window, one tile of records, is shorter than the input, the pass first runs on a copy of the window's keys to estimate the number of swaps, and only then touches the records with a budget scaled to the whole input. If the budget runs out, the input is left as a stable permutation of itself and the radix path continues. See [Insertion and scans](#insertion-and-scans) for how the pass finds inversions.

### 2. Varying bits

One scan computes the bitwise union and intersection of all keys. Bits that are equal in every key cannot change the order and are excluded from every later digit. A constant input returns at this point. Wide keys whose variation fits in one 64-bit half are sorted by that half as a 64-bit key.

### 3. Node partitioning

A node whose remaining variation spans at most eight bits is one window away from sorted. When the records are their own keys (`Direct`), it is finished by counting that window: one `usize` count and one remembered record per bucket, then each run is filled from its record. Every sealed encoding is a bijection on bit patterns, so equal keys mean equal records and a filled run is the same permutation the block partition would produce, without block tables or record moves. A user key function keeps payloads that its key does not identify, so `ByKey` declines and takes the partition. See [decision 0012](../decisions/0012-count-narrow-direct-windows.md).

Otherwise the node is split by one of three partitions, all of them stable. The first two are tried only on nodes of at least four tiles, which amortize their 64-key sample:

- **Repeated key.** The node samples 64 keys in runs of 8. If one value covers at least a quarter of the sample, an equality partition separates it from the rest, so heavily repeated keys stop costing passes.
- **Outlier run.** If a short run at either end of the node (at most 1,024 records) disagrees with all other records on the highest varying bit, the run is split off and finished by insertion sort, and the rest of the node keeps a narrower set of varying bits.
- **Top digit.** Otherwise the node is split on its top digit. The initial width is 8 bits and may grow to 12; a sample of 128 keys checks that the digit actually divides the range.

The digit partition uses the block LSD scheme of Clausecker and Schintke. Buckets are filled block by block, consumed input blocks are reused as output blocks, and permutation metadata records their logical order. Stability holds without a full-size output buffer, and the extra space is O(√n) for a fixed digit width and record size. The block size in records is

```
max(1, 4 * ceil(sqrt(10n / (2 R s))), floor(1024 / s), 32)
```

where `n` is the input length, `s` the record size and `R` the number of buckets.

The root is the paper's trade-off evaluated for this implementation. A block size `b` costs `2 R b s` bytes of scratch — one output block per bucket, plus as many in reserve, because an input block may only be recycled once every record in it has been read — and `10 n / b` bytes of tables, because a block position owns two `u32` block-order entries and one `u16` bucket id. The two terms are equal at that root, so it is the minimum of the sum: substituting `b = c b*` multiplies the total by `(c + 1/c) / 2`, which grows in both directions. The engine takes four times that root: the minimum is where memory is smallest, not where the sort is fastest, and a larger block amortises the random read that compaction pays per block.

The lower bounds are not from the paper. The compaction pass moves a block with one copy, so a block holds at least a kilobyte of records; and the bookkeeping of a block does not shrink with the record, so a block holds at least 32 records whatever their width. Their cost does not depend on `n`, so the O(√n) bound holds for a fixed record size and digit width.

Buckets that fit a tile are finished as tiles during compaction. Larger buckets become nodes and are partitioned again.

### 4. Tile finishing

A tile is finished by one of three leaves:

- **Insertion sort** for tiles and buckets of at most 48 records.
- **Tile-local MSD partition**, recursing into buckets with a cursor table on the stack.
- **LSD counting passes** over a scratch buffer, with digit widths between 6 and 14 bits.

The leaf and the digit widths are chosen by a cost model that counts passes and charges for bucket tables. An MSD level is charged as one counting pass plus one pass for the insertion finish that ends the descent.

## Insertion and scans

Every insertion pass, whether a budgeted probe or the finish of a tile or bucket, runs one loop, `insertion_loop`: it scans for the first adjacent pair whose keys descend, moves the later record left, and resumes the scan after it. A probe returns its swap count and may stop at its budget. A finishing pass, `finish_insertion`, has no budget and returns `()`, so the unused count is discarded inside the inlined loop rather than returned across a target-feature boundary ([decision 0008](../decisions/0008-insertion-finishing-entry-point.md)).

The scan depends on the extractor and the build:

| Pass | Default build | `portable-simd` |
|---|---|---|
| Key function (`stable_sort_by_key`) | One record at a time, keeping the previous key, so the key function runs once per scanned record | Same |
| Direct keys, budgeted probe | Blocked scan of 32 pairs per mask update (`scan::first_inversion`); `f64` uses the scalar scan | Vector scan, with the instruction set selected once per pass |
| Direct keys, insertion finish | Scalar scan: the short ordered runs a radix partition leaves do not amortize a block mask ([decision 0014](../decisions/0014-scalar-default-insertion-finishing.md)) | Vector scan, with the instruction set selected once per pass |
| Direct keys, ascending confirmation | Scalar scan | The vector scan, dispatched once ([decision 0010](../decisions/0010-vector-ascending-confirmation.md)) |

With `portable-simd`, slices shorter than 64 records and 128-bit and pointer-sized keys scan one pair at a time, and `Reverse<K>` keys keep the default-build scans. The insertion loop is inlined into the dispatched function, so its scan runs with the selected target features ([decision 0007](../decisions/0007-optional-simd-backend.md)).

## Record handling

Records are moved by bitwise copies between the input and `MaybeUninit<T>` scratch. Every record has exactly one live owner at any time; other physical copies are stale bytes that are never dropped, borrowed or returned.

Each counting pass reads the keys twice: once for the histogram and once to scatter the records. How the second read happens depends on who computes the key.

- **User key functions** (`stable_sort_by_key`). The histogram stores a two-byte bucket number per record, and scatter reads it instead of calling the key function again. Bucket ranges are disjoint, so each output slot is written exactly once whatever the key function returns. This keeps `String`, `Box<T>` and `&mut T` records safe and every record type on one path.
- **Library-encoded keys** (`stable_sort`). The keys are the records and are encoded by Tessera, so they are deterministic. Scatter recomputes them and stores nothing.

The research prototype skipped the stored bucket numbers for `Copy` records. It filled scratch with valid records on the first pass, so a misbehaving key function could duplicate or drop records but never expose uninitialized memory. The cost of storing bucket numbers for every record type is measured in the [port record](port.md#performance).

## Panic safety

Key functions are user code and may panic. On a panic:

- the block partition rebuilds each block's offsets from the bucket fill counts and the number of complete input blocks, then moves every live record back into the input slice;
- a tile keeps a pointer to the complete record set from the last finished pass and copies it back if needed;
- the panic is then resumed.

The slice holds every record afterwards, in an unspecified order. No record is dropped twice or leaked.

Without the `std` feature, a panic cannot be caught. A key-function panic during block partitioning, where the input slice does not own every record, aborts through an unwind guard; panics elsewhere unwind with every record in place ([decision 0006](../decisions/0006-no-std-unwind-guard.md)).

## Stack usage

Each tile-local MSD level keeps a cursor table of up to 32 KiB on the stack. The depth is bounded by ⌈key bits / 6⌉, at most 22 levels for 128-bit keys. Actual frame sizes depend on the compiler.
