# 0008: Give insertion finishing a unit-returning entry point

Date: 2026-11-07. Status: accepted.

## Context

The engine uses insertion both to estimate work within a swap budget and to finish a partitioned tile. A probe needs its swap count and may stop early. A finishing pass needs every record sorted; its count is unused.

Returning both results through the same runtime-dispatched entry point can hide the finishing pass's constant budget and unused result from the compiler. Its target-feature function then retains swap accounting that the caller discards. Splitting the call also changes scalar inlining: a default scan that becomes an out-of-line helper adds a call per inversion search.

## Decision

Keep one insertion loop and expose two extractor operations:

- `insertion_sort` accepts a budget and returns `Option<usize>` for probes.
- `finish_insertion` returns `()` and supplies `usize::MAX` to that same loop.

The finishing wrapper is inlined inside the selected target-feature context, so its unused swap count can disappear before that function returns. Both operations have the same meaning in the default and portable SIMD backends. Backend selection controls the scan implementation and dispatch timing.

Keep the direct scan chain inlined, as the SIMD scan already is. This exposes the caller's slice bounds and prevents a separate call for every scan. User key functions retain their existing scan and inlining policy.

A portable insertion pass shorter than the existing `SIMD_MIN` stays scalar without runtime dispatch. Every suffix it subsequently scans is shorter too, so it cannot reach a vector kernel. This reuses the scan's existing gate; there is no new tuning parameter. Routing, digit planning and tile limits stay unchanged.

## Consequences

The ordering, stability, panic and workspace contracts stay unchanged. No record cache or scratch allocation is added. The compiler may instantiate separate probe and finishing functions and duplicate inlined scan code, so both feature configurations need performance checks, including long inputs.

Acceptance follows the [benchmark protocol](../development/benchmarking.md): nine shuffled blocks, duplicate baseline timings, independently named source copies, verified outputs, and separate API and prepared-workspace runs. Raw data, executable snapshots and the diagnostic accounting ablation remain outside the repository.

## Alternatives considered

A feature-dependent accounting policy couples a caller's need for a result to the available instruction set. Separate sorting loops duplicate the ordering and recovery logic. A shared loop with operation-specific return values preserves one algorithm while exposing the information the compiler needs at each call boundary.
