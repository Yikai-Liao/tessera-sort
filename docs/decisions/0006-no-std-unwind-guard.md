# 0006: Guard record movement against unwinding without std

Date: 2026-11-07. Status: accepted. Supersedes the panic-strategy requirement and safety rationale in [0005](0005-no-std-with-alloc.md).

## Context

`no_std` does not select a panic strategy. A dependency built without its `std` feature can still run in a host program that unwinds. Requiring `panic = "abort"` in documentation does not protect a safe API from such a caller.

During block scatter, consumed input blocks become output blocks before the ownership directory is rebuilt. If unwinding interrupts that phase, the pass-boundary `Drop` restoration uses an incomplete directory and can duplicate owning records, causing a double free. This is a memory-safety issue, not merely a leak. A callback panic during block materialization likewise must not unwind through an incomplete directory.

## Decision

Keep the `std` recovery path unchanged. In the no-std implementation of `unwind::catch`, place an abort-on-unwind guard around the closure. Forget the guard after a normal return. If the closure unwinds, the guard's destructor panics during cleanup, which aborts before the block sorter's destructor can attempt restoration. This uses only `core`, adds no dependency, and works with both aborting and unwinding hosts.

The guard covers block scatter and its materialization callbacks. Key-function panics elsewhere may unwind safely through the existing tile restoration or before records are moved. The public contract documents this distinction; applications need not choose a particular panic strategy.

Use the integer `isqrt` method from `core`, stable since Rust 1.84 and available at the crate's Rust 1.85 MSRV, for no-std block sizing. A single conditional increment rounds its floor result up. Keep the measured `std` floating-point formula and the comparison between both forms.

## Alternatives considered

- **Reject no-std builds with `cfg(panic = "unwind")`.** This prevents the unsafe combination, but also rejects host uses and the normal stable test harness. A guard protects the actual ownership boundary without this restriction.
- **Repair interrupted scatter in `Drop`.** This needs the scatter cursors and completion protocol restructured. It is unnecessary for an abort-on-panic contract and would change the existing recovery mechanism.

## Consequences

- A subprocess regression test verifies that a key panic during block scatter aborts under the host unwinder for both free functions and a reused workspace. The fallback exits without dropping possibly duplicated owning records, so a double free cannot masquerade as successful abort protection.
- Inconsistent-key tests for owning and exclusively borrowed records run with and without `std`; only panic-recovery cases require the feature. Miri runs both feature configurations, excluding the subprocess test.
- Square-boundary tests check integer rounding independently of the floating comparison. No routing, thresholds, or `std` block sizes change.
