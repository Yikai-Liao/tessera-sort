# 0015: Align branches in continuous benchmark builds

Date: 2026-11-07. Status: accepted. Amends the shared build flags and history transition of [0011](0011-benchmark-feature-configurations.md).

## Context

Adding a benchmark changes the executable's layout, even when the existing sorting instructions remain the same. On Intel CPUs affected by the JCC erratum, branches crossing or ending on a 32-byte boundary can lose access to the decoded instruction cache after the microcode mitigation. The [port experiments](../design/port.md#rebuild-and-branch-alignment-check) identified large placement effects that branch alignment removed on the tested ordered inputs, while other placement effects remained.

## Decision

Add `-C llvm-args=-x86-branches-within-32B-boundaries` to both continuous benchmark builds, Default and Portable SIMD. Keep static glibc linking and runtime SIMD dispatch. Apply the flag in the benchmark workflow, without changing the crate's build configuration or the release report's default profile.

Keep Testbeds `intel-v1` and `intel-v1-portable-simd`, their hardware spec, benchmark IDs and existing histories. Do not add a configuration or reset history for this flag change.

## Consequences

The first aligned measurements compare against unaligned baselines, so alerts at the transition may reflect the build flag alone. The previous sample rule from [0013](0013-compare-with-the-previous-main-sample.md) uses an aligned baseline once an aligned `main` result exists at a PR's base commit. Earlier-base PRs still inherit their earlier baseline.

Branch alignment changes code size and absolute timing. It targets a known Intel boundary hazard, not every source of layout sensitivity, and does not prove the cause of any particular benchmark alert. Performance claims still require the benchmark protocol's A/A and placement controls. The LLVM option must remain supported by the compiler used to build the benchmarks.
