# 0011: Track default and Portable SIMD benchmarks independently

Date: 2026-11-07. Status: accepted.

The shared build flags and history transition are amended by [decision 0015](0015-align-continuous-benchmark-branches.md).

## Context

Portable SIMD is optional and off by default. Measuring only that build leaves the default build without regression coverage. The two builds have different performance characteristics, so sharing a baseline or combining their geometric means can hide a regression.

The report publisher identifies PR comments by language and commit. Two independent publishers for the same Rust commit would overwrite each other's report.

## Decision

Build the same Criterion suite with default features and with `tessera-sort/portable-simd` added. Keep the compiler, flags, cases and hardware specification the same. Preserve runtime SIMD dispatch without forcing or disabling any instruction set. Default builds may still use compiler auto-vectorization.

Retain Testbed `intel-v1` for Default and `intel-v1-portable-simd` for Portable SIMD, both using hardware spec `intel-v1`. Each configuration has its own baseline, thresholds, alerts and PR history. Run the executables as two sequential remote jobs with independent timeouts under the existing concurrency group. Continue to the second measurement if the first fails.

Publish a separate GitHub Check for each configuration, named `Benchmarks (rust, Default)` and `Benchmarks (rust, Portable SIMD)` after the configuration names in the comment. After measuring both, publish one job summary and one PR comment. In that comment, configurations are columns and cases are rows: one overview table, one comparison chart and one PR history chart, and one table of changed cases, each with a column per configuration. A case is named once, and each alert states whether it occurs in every configuration or only in some. Compute changes and geometric means within each configuration; there is no mean across them. Preserve the existing same-head comment update and superseded-head rules.

API variants of one executable, such as the stable sort with or without a prepared workspace, and later an unstable or parallel sort, are not configurations. They are the mode segment of the case ID, measured in the same remote run, and the report groups them as rows. Only a change to how the executable is built adds a configuration, and with it a column, a Testbed, a remote job and a check. Separate sections or chart pairs per configuration were rejected: they repeat every case name per build, push the second build's charts below the first build's tables, and multiply with every further build or API.

## Consequences

Both supported configurations receive regression coverage, at the cost of two remote runs per measured commit. Existing histories remain usable because neither build's compiler flags nor case IDs change. Main needs enough samples in both Testbeds before both comparisons can alert.

A failed measurement remains visible without hiding the other result. Repository rules requiring the old `Benchmarks (rust)` check must switch to the two configuration-specific checks. Continuous results remain regression signals; performance claims still need the full A/A and placement controls of the benchmark protocol.
