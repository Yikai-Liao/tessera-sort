//! Stable radix sort with O(√n) auxiliary memory.
//!
//! Tessera sorts slices by a primitive key: an integer up to 128 bits, an
//! `f32` or `f64`, or [`Reverse`](core::cmp::Reverse) of one of these. It runs
//! in linear time for a fixed key width, keeps records with equal keys in
//! input order, and needs no `Copy`, `Clone`, `Default` or `Ord` on the
//! records it moves.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use core::cmp::Reverse;
//! use tessera_sort::{stable_sort, stable_sort_by_key};
//!
//! let mut keys = [42, -7, 42, 0];
//! stable_sort(&mut keys);
//! assert_eq!(keys, [-7, 0, 42, 42]);
//!
//! // Equal keys keep their input order, also when sorting in descending order.
//! let mut rows = [(2u32, "first"), (1, "middle"), (2, "last")];
//! stable_sort_by_key(&mut rows, |row| Reverse(row.0));
//! assert_eq!(rows, [(2, "first"), (2, "last"), (1, "middle")]);
//! ```
//!
//! # Ordering
//!
//! Integers sort in their usual order. Floats follow [`f64::total_cmp`]:
//! `-0.0` sorts before `+0.0`, and NaNs sort by sign and payload, negative NaNs
//! first and positive NaNs last. To treat every NaN or both zeros as equal,
//! normalize the key in the key function. For descending order, wrap the key in
//! `Reverse` rather than reversing an ascending result, which would also
//! reverse the order of equal keys.
//!
//! # Memory
//!
//! Inputs larger than one 64 KiB tile are split by a stable block partition
//! that needs O(√n) records of scratch for a fixed record size and key width.
//! Each tile is then sorted in a scratch buffer of at most 64 KiB of records,
//! plus up to two bytes per record of cached bucket IDs for
//! [`stable_sort_by_key`]. Each tile-local MSD level also keeps a cursor table
//! of up to 32 KiB on the stack, with at most 22 levels for 128-bit keys.
//!
//! The free functions allocate this scratch during each call. A [`Workspace`]
//! keeps it between calls.
//!
//! # Cargo features
//!
//! `std` is enabled by default. Disable it for `no_std`: the crate then uses
//! `core` and `alloc`, so it needs a global allocator. A key-function panic
//! during block partitioning aborts rather than exposing partially moved
//! records, even when the host enables unwinding. Panics elsewhere may unwind
//! safely. Sorting, ordering and the memory bounds above are the same either way.
//!
//! `portable-simd` is off by default and requires `std` and Rust 1.89 or newer.
//! It adds [`fearless_simd`](https://docs.rs/fearless_simd) for adjacent-key
//! scans, ascending-order confirmation and bucket-count prefix sums. On x86 it
//! selects a supported instruction set at run time, once per insertion pass,
//! ascending confirmation or prefix sum. Other targets use their compile-time
//! baseline, including Arm Neon and WebAssembly SIMD when enabled for the
//! target. Keys without a vector kernel use scalar scans. Results are the same
//! with and without the feature.
