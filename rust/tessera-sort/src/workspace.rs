/// Scratch memory kept between sorts of `T` records.

/// The free functions allocate scratch during each call and free it before
/// returning. A workspace keeps that capacity instead, so after the first sort
/// only a larger input allocates again. Its methods behave exactly like the
/// free functions of the same name and produce the same results.
///
/// A workspace keeps capacity, never records: each call starts from empty
/// scratch, and a workspace stays usable after a key function panics. Sorting
/// takes `&mut self`, so use one workspace per thread. The workspace is typed
/// by the record, not the key, so one workspace serves every key type.
///
/// # Memory
///
/// The workspace keeps the largest capacity it has used until
/// [`shrink_to_fit`](Self::shrink_to_fit) releases it. A key-function panic
/// may drop part of the block-partition capacity; the next call allocates it
/// again. [`retained_bytes`](Self::retained_bytes) reports the heap capacity.
///

///     workspace.stable_sort_by_key(&mut batch, |row| row.0);
