> [!IMPORTANT]
> Tessera is in pre-release. The Rust engine has been ported to Stable Rust and checked against the research prototype. Nothing is on crates.io yet; see the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

## Why Tessera

An LSD radix sort is stable and runs in linear time, but it needs a second buffer as large as the input. Comparison sorts avoid that buffer and pay O(n log n) comparisons instead. Tessera keeps the radix sort's linear time and stability and bounds the extra memory to O(√n).

- **Stable**, also for descending keys.
- **O(√n) auxiliary memory**, through a stable in-place block partition and a bounded 64 KiB tile buffer.
- **Adaptive.** Sorted, reverse-sorted, nearly sorted and heavily repeated inputs take shortcuts, and constant key bits are skipped.
- **Any record type.** No `Copy`, `Clone`, `Default` or `Ord` needed. Records are moved, never duplicated, even if the key function misbehaves or panics.
- **Wide keys.** Integers up to 128 bits, `f32` and `f64` in `total_cmp` order, and `Reverse<K>`.
- **No required dependencies.** Pure Rust; the optional `portable-simd` feature adds `fearless_simd`. `std` is optional: without it the crate is `no_std` and needs `alloc`.

## Quick start

> The crate is not published yet. The example uses the implemented 0.1 API.

```toml
[dependencies]
tessera-sort = "0.1"
```

In a `no_std` program, disable the default `std` feature. The crate then uses `core` and `alloc`, so a global allocator must exist. A key-function panic during block partitioning aborts, even when the host enables unwinding:

```toml
[dependencies]
tessera-sort = { version = "0.1", default-features = false }
```

```rust
use std::cmp::Reverse;

let mut values: Vec<u64> = vec![42, 7, 19, 7, 3];
tessera_sort::stable_sort(&mut values);
assert_eq!(values, [3, 7, 7, 19, 42]);

// Sort records by a key; equal keys keep their input order.
let mut rows = vec![(2u32, "first"), (1, "middle"), (2, "last")];
tessera_sort::stable_sort_by_key(&mut rows, |row| Reverse(row.0));
assert_eq!(rows, [(2, "first"), (2, "last"), (1, "middle")]);
```

| API | Use |
|---|---|
| `stable_sort(&mut [K])` | Sort keys themselves |
| `stable_sort_by_key(&mut [T], F)` | Sort any records by a key computed by `F` |
| `Workspace<T>` | The same sorts as methods, reusing scratch memory across calls ([guide](docs/guide/workspace.md)) |

Tessera does not take a comparator: an arbitrary `Ordering` cannot be turned into radix digits.

## Performance

Track Rust benchmark trends on the [public Bencher dashboard](https://bencher.dev/perf/yikai-liao-s-project). These continuous measurements flag changes to investigate; performance claims require the [A/B protocol](docs/development/benchmarking.md).

> [!NOTE]
> TODO: performance results will be published with the benchmark runner ([roadmap](ROADMAP.md)). This README provides no performance data until then.

## When to use something else

- **Orders defined by a comparator**, strings, or other variable-length keys: use `slice::sort_by`.
- **Parallel sorting**: Tessera is single-threaded.
- **No allocator**: Tessera needs O(√n) scratch memory, so it cannot run without `alloc` (or, in C++, without a heap).

## Status by language

Each language package is versioned and released separately ([`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md)). No package has been released yet.

| Capability | Rust (unreleased) | C++ |
|---|---|---|
| Stable sort | Implemented | Planned |
| Unstable sort | Not in 0.1 | Planned |
| 128-bit keys | Signed and unsigned | Planned |
| Records that own resources or hold `&mut` | Supported | Trivially copyable records only (planned) |
| Reusable workspace | Supported | Planned |

A Python binding is planned as well; see the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md).
